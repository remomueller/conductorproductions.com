          Our studio production for NEBH featuring Avery Bradley is a 2017 company favorite. We love the blend of musicality, artistry, and athleticism that is depicted in this campaign, and working with Proper Villains Agency with the talented direction of Jeff Monahan and Patrick Ruth was a joy.

          Conductor's testimonial-driven DR spots are a style we have become
          renown for... and these commercials we wrote, shot, and edited for
          Grammarly prove just how well they produce results. Our client
          reported 45 million organic YouTube views in one week. And that's
          before even going to air!

          Another highlight of the year was our video campaign for WB Mason,
          spearheaded by producer-extraordinaire, Jenn Sargent. We shot six
          unique comedic spots, one of which set in Santa's Workshop at the
          North Pole. Christmas came quite early for us this year!

          We really had a lot of fun launching into a completely different genre
          for our newest broadcast client, Hunt A Killer. This past month has
          been a wild ride exploring the psychological thriller world through
          visual effects and sound design. Do you have what it takes to catch a
          serial killer?

        .yir-content
          Great reports are coming in from this repeat client since teaming with
          Conductor. The spots we've produced with Adore Me this year have been
          outperforming all their previous TV creative and, in their own words,
          they "couldn't be happier with Conductor's value, quality, and
          results."
