# This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will
# include all the files listed below.
#
# Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts,
# vendor/assets/javascripts, or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory
# can be referenced here using a relative path.
#
# It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at
# the bottom of the compiled file. JavaScript code in this file should be added
# after the last require_* statement.
